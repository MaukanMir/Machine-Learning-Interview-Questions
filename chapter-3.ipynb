    "## Interview question 3-13: What’s the difference between content-based recommender systems and collaborative filtering recommender systems? When would you use one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example answer\n",
    "- Content-based recommender systems require knowledge of categorization or traits of the products being recommended to determine product similarity. Collaborative filtering relies on user behavior and user preferences to recommend products that users with similar tastes enjoyed and thus can be more ignorant about the products themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hence, content-based recommenders work well when there are not many users or items to construct the user-item matrix for collaborative filtering. In other words, content-based recommenders can still make recommendations when there is the “cold-start” problem, as long as there is information on the features of the items/products and some information on the traits or preferences of the users, without requiring more data on user behavior and interactions like collaborative filtering does.\n",
    "\n",
    "-On the other hand, collaborative filtering is suited for scenarios in which a lot of data on user behavior is available. At times, it can be hard to gather sufficient, meaningful features that describe the products, which makes content-based recommender systems ineffective. In these cases, collaborative filtering can be more suitable."
