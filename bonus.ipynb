    "### Secondly, note that there are two sources of data: historical and live. Many statistical models assume that the distribution of data stays the same over time. (The technical term is that the distribution is stationary.) But in practice, the distribution of data changes over time, sometimes drastically. This is called distribution drift. As an example, think about building a recommender for news articles. The trending topics change every day, sometimes every hour; what was popular yesterday may no longer be relevant today. One can imagine the distribution of user preference for news articles changing rapidly over time. Hence it’s important to be able to detect distribution drift and adapt the model accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One way to detect distribution drift is to continue to track the model’s performance on the validation metric on live data. If the performance is comparable to the validation results when the model was built, then the model still fits the data. When performance starts to degrade, then it’s probable that the distribution of live data has drifted sufficiently from historical data, and it’s time to retrain the model. Monitoring for distribution drift is often done “offline” from the production environment. Hence we are grouping it into offline evaluation.\n",

    "## Log Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### The beautiful thing about this definition is that it is intimately tied to information theory: log-loss is the cross entropy between the distribution of the true labels and the predictions, and it is very closely related to what’s known as the relative entropy, or Kullback–Leibler divergence. Entropy measures the unpredictability of something. Cross entropy incorporates the entropy of the true distribution, plus the extra unpredictability when one assumes a different distribution than the true distribution. So log-loss is an information-theoretic measure to gauge the “extra noise” that comes from using a predictor as opposed to the true labels. By minimizing the cross entropy, we maximize the accuracy of the classifier."

    "## AUC VS ROC\n",
    "\n",
    "###  The ROC curve shows the sensitivity of the classifier by plotting the rate of true positives to the rate of false positives (see Figure 2-2). In other words, it shows you how many correct positive classifications can be gained as you allow for more and more false positives. The perfect classifier that makes no mistakes would hit a true positive rate of 100% immediately, without incurring any false positives—this almost never happens in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ROC curve is not just a single number; it is a whole curve. It provides nuanced details about the behavior of the classifier, but it’s hard to quickly compare many ROC curves to each other. In particular, if one were to employ some kind of automatic hyperparameter tuning mechanism (a topic we will cover in Chapter 4), the machine would need a quantifiable score instead of a plot that requires visual inspection. The AUC is one way to summarize the ROC curve into a single number, so that it can be compared easily and automatically. A good ROC curve has a lot of space under it (because the true positive rate shoots up to 100% very quickly). A bad ROC curve covers very little area. So high AUC is good, and low AUC is not so good."

    "## A & B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### This machinery is known as statistical hypothesis testing. It decides between a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis. Most of the time, A/B tests are formulated to answer the question, “Does this new model lead to a statistically significant change in the key metric?” The null hypothesis is often “the new model doesn’t change the average value of the key metric,” and the alternative hypothesis “the new model changes the average value of the key metric.” The test for the average value (the population mean, in statistical speak) is the most common, but there are tests for other population parameters as well."
